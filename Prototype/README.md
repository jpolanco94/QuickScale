# QuickScale ProtoType
So far I have been able to play with Visual Studios to develop a more definitive feel for the front end portion of my app.
### Front Page

I have stated that I want the front page to be a very simple and easy to navigate page. There is still more work to be done 
in terms of choosing font size, color, and what to do with the blurb in the middle of the page.

### Scales and Chords Page.
