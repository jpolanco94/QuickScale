# QuickScale ProtoTypes
This is where I keep all the the source code for my prototypes. I have created different prototypes for trying out different approaches to creating this application to see which one seems to be the most feasible for a project of this size.

## Code First Approach
The code first approach to creating a web application is the one I feel most confident with at the moment. Currently I have completed my models. I have created a handful of views and controllers that will take user input (either a user choosing a scale or creating an account) and been able to save that to a database and also display in on the web page to ensure my database and code are connected. I have also added encryption to the saved passwords. At the moment, my biggest concern is in finding a way to display an accurate and easily readable fretboard.
