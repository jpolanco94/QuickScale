            Hello. Welcome to Quick Scales. This was designed for guitar players of all
            levels as a quick reference guide for any scales you may want to look up. What
            makes this app different is that it allows you to customize the scales you are
            viewing. What this means is that you can change the number of frets, strings,
            and even tunings and the app will display the notes accordingly.
