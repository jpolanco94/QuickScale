## 1.Concept and Top Level User Requirements
QuickScale is a web application that serves as an easily accessible, readable, and adjustable quick reference guide of scales and chords for guitarist of all levels. The following are the fundamental requirements this application must fulfill:
* The web app should be able to clearly present scales and chords in a way that makes sense.
* The web app should let users be able to select what scales and chords that want to view.
* The web app should be easy to navigate.
* The web app should allow for some level of customizazation.

**Note** It is assumed that the users of this application will already have some knowldege of how to play the guitar. Even though this app caters to guitarist with some skill, it can help absolute beginners by providing links to other helpful materials.

## 2.Requirements

Above is a preliminary requirements traceability matrix. As I continue to add to the prototype of the web application the software and systems requirements will grow.

## 3.Solution Design
![UseCase](https://github.com/jpolanco94/QuickScale/blob/master/UseCase.jpeg)
One of the features of this app is letting users create an account. I will still like users without an account to have full access to the app. This is why there are three users in this use case diagram. The only features a user with an account will have is a way to track which scales they viewed last and which scales are viewed often. The administrator will have access to a database that contains all users' login information.

## 4.Database Design

One of the bigger issues I face in creating this app is the way in which the scales and chords are displayed. Once I can figure that out the ERD will change almost entirely. More information here (link).

## 5.Wireframe Details
![Home Page](https://github.com/jpolanco94/QuickScale/blob/master/Home%20Page%20Quick%20Scale.jpeg)
The home page will be the most basic page on this web application. The first option the users can pick is the chord and scale viewer and
is explained below. The second option is to play a game meant to help guitarist memorize scales or fretboard notes. The user may also 
decide to visit his account. I have not yet decided that color scheme for the web app but I know I want to use softer colors and also
give the user the option to change up some colors.
